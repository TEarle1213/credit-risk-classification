# credit-risk-classification
 
## Technologies
  Python, Pandas, sklearn.metrics, imbalanced_learn, jupyter notebook

## Resources
 Data for this dataset was generated by edX Boot Camps LLC
 
 ## Purpose
  Split data into training and testing sets to use a machine learning model in order to classify home loan risk. Run logistic regressions on the testing data and find the precision of the model through use of a confusion matrix, accuracy scoring, and classification reporting. 
  
 ## Analysis Methods
  - Split data into training and testing sets.
  - Created Logistic Regression model to generate predictions.
  - Evaluated accuracy of model.
  - Used imbalanced_learn's RandomOverSampler to resample and retest the data.
  - Created new Logistic Regression model and evaluated accuracy of new model.
